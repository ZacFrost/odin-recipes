    <h3>Steps :</h3>
    <ol>
        <p>Prepare saffron-kewra water and chop veggies</p>
        <li>
            To make a delightful chicken biryani dish firstly soak saffron in water to prepare saffron water (One tsp
            saffron can be soaked in 1/4 cup water). Next, mix kewra drops in water and mix well to make kewra water.
            Set them aside for later usage. Now chop the onion and coriander leaves and keep them aside.
        </li>

        <p>Saute the onions</p>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, heat refined oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds, bay leaf,
            green cardamom, black cardamom, cloves in it, and saute for about a minute. Then, add chopped onion to it
            and saute until pink. Now, add chicken into it with slit green chillies, turmeric, salt to taste, ginger
            garlic paste, red chilli powder and green chilli paste. Mix well all the spices and cook for 2-3 minutes.
            Then, add hung curd into it and give a mix. (Make sure the chicken is washed properly and patted dry before
            adding it to the dish.
        </li>

        <p>Cook biryani on low heat for 5-6 minutes</p>
        <li>
            Turn the flame to medium again and add garam masala in it along with ginger julienned, coriander and mint
            leaves. Add kewra water, rose water and saffron water in it. Cook till the chicken is tender. Then add 1 cup
            cooked rice and spread evenly. Then add saffron water and pour ghee over it. You can now cook the dish
            without the lid or cover it with a lid to give a dum-effect due to the steam formation.
        </li>

        <p>Serve hot chicken biryani</p>
        <li>
            Cook for 15-20 minutes with a closed lid and garnish with 1 tbsp fried onions and coriander leaves. Serve
            hot chicken biryani. Enjoy!
