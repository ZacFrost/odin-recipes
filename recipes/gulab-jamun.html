        <p>
            This classic Indian dessert usually enjoyed during festive occasions, might seem impossible to make at home
            but
            can actually be easily made at home without any fuss. Gulab meaning rose and Jamun meaning berry makes for
            Gulab
            Jamun as a berry-sized ball dunken in rose flavoured sugar syrup. It can be served hot with vanilla
            ice-cream or
            just a stand-alone chilled dish.
